      introduction: "The Build for the Future (BFF) assessment is our assessment tool for an organization's digital and AI maturity to accelerate transformation journeys. It helps to set the right ambition level and to understand what is key to succeed in the digital and AI age. The BFF Assessment is a top level executive assessment of the digital and AI maturity across eight building blocks and 53 dimensions. The survey should take approximately 30-minutes to complete. The survey is anonymous and your answers will not be attributed back to you. Please provide honest and candid ratings and commentary. Please note: If you plan to make a pause while filling out the survey, the survey is saved automatically as you answer. If you want to resume from where you left off, make sure you use the same browser and the same device. Thank you! In order to complete this survey you will be asked, for every dimension considered, to provide a view on: the current maturity of the organization; the target state that it is trying to achieve in 3 years; the importance that each dimension has for the company. We encourage you to provide specific examples to support your assessment or any other additional information that you deem as relevant in the comments box below each question.",
